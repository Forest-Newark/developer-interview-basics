# Data Structures

The following is a high level overview of core data structures that will be explored more throughly in this project. 

---

##### Array
 
An array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements of the same data type in a contiguous block of memory, each element accessible by its index.

---

##### Stack

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, where elements can be added or removed only from the top, resembling a stack of plates or books.

---

##### Queue

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, where elements are inserted at the rear and removed from the front, resembling a line of people waiting for a service.

---

##### Linked List

A linked list is a linear data structure in which elements, called nodes, are connected through pointers, with each node containing data and a reference to the next node in the sequence.

---

##### Binary Tree

A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes, where each node has at most two children (left and right), forming a tree-like structure.

---

##### Graph

A graph is a non-linear data structure composed of nodes (vertices) connected by edges, representing a collection of interconnected relationships.

---

##### Trie

A trie is a tree-like data structure that stores a dynamic set of strings, where each node represents a common prefix, and the paths to the leaf nodes collectively form the strings

---

##### Hash Table

A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs and uses a hash function to compute an index (hash code) to efficiently retrieve, insert, or delete elements based on their keys
