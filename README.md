# developer-interview-basics
This Repo has been created as I collect and the organize basic information required for software developer interviews. 

As a former teacher, it helps me to create material as I learn, and refresh my understanding of the essential knowledge for software development. 

This repo is is intended for my personal use, but I have made the repo public in case it can be helpful to anyone else preparing for a software development interview.
